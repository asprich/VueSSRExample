# Server Side Rendering Vue with Parcel

The goal for this repository is to provide a end to end example/tutorial (or course at this point) for server side rending vue. We'll be using parcel as I don't want to get into the complexities of webpack here. I really want to keep this as simple and straight forward as possible, that being said I've also found that introducing server side rendering is not a simple and straight forward task and there's a fair bit of little gotchyas along the way.

Here's an over view what we'll be covering.

Each part or lesson builds on the code written in the previous part. The commits in master line up with the code you should have at the end of each lesson. Git is great for this. You can check the diff to easily see all the code written for each lesson.
